# text-based-editor

## USES CASES

We want you to build a minimal example of a text-based form editor with import and export functionalities for created forms.
For a deeper understanding of the core functionality, you also can have a look at Notion or Clickup.

It must be possible to type /{command} into the editor field, while command is one of the given functions:
- /headline: inserts and renders a html \<h1\> headline into the editor window.
- /textinput: inserts and renders a html \<input\> field into the editors window
- /option: inserts and renders a html \<option\> field with 3 possible options. options
The surrounding html form tag and the submit button is already given.

### Level 2:
Add a functionality to import and export the created form in json format.

### Level 3:
Make the individual form components drag and drop-able, so they can be reordered.
